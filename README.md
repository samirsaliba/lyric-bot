# lyric-bot
Twitter bot that tweets lyrics from a text file.
Since I'm a big Kanye West fan, this one specifically posts Kanye West's songs lyrics.
I split the lyrics from each album into a text file;
Then, the bot randomly selects one album (i.e. text file) and reads one of the "bars" from it to post on Twitter.
I followed this great, simple tutorial made by the great @ShawnToubeau (thanks, Shawn!):
